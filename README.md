# hello-world
my first program to keep tradition alive
10 years in IT, always wanted to get into programming but couldn't get past the boring parts. Decided to commit finally and started reading books, doing tutorials and ordering video lessons online. Plan is to become fluent in Python and use this skill at work to help with automation to save time and money for my company and also build projects for fun. Keeping this fun is key to keeping me on the rigth track and interested.
